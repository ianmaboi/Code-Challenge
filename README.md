# Code-Challenge
#### **By Ian Maboi 24/09/2023
## Project Description
#### Grade Generator
   The code challenge that am creating is to write a function that prompts the user to input students marks. The input should be between 0 and 100. The output should correspond the correct grade , as shown below :

    A > 79, B -60 to 79, C-59 to 49, D- 40 to 49, E- less 40.
#### Speed Detector
    Write a program that takes the speed of a car as input e.g 80. If the speed is lesss than 70, it should print "Ok".Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speeed limit (70), iy should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points.

    >For example, if speed is 80, it should print: "Points :2".If the driver gets more than 12 points, the function should print"License suspended".
